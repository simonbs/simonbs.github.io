iPhone X and iOS 11 introduces Animojis, short 10 seconds recordings of facial gestures transposed onto an emoji. As of writing this, the feature is restricted to Apples Messages app.

Using private API I built and [open sourced](https://github.com/simonbs/SBSAnimojis) a standalone Animoji app that increases the length of the recordings and enables users to share the videos to social medias or save them to the pohto library.
